# Developing-Data-Products
This App is a project for coursera class "Developing Data Products", it is an extension of the exponential distribution simulation of the Coursera class "Statistical Inference".

The simulation create a sample size of exponential distribution for mutliple time, then take the mean and variance of the distribution into two arrays, finally plot out these two array to see how they approach theoractical values as the simulation times goes. This app also plot out the histogram of the mean array to show that how it approach normal distribution as the simulation times goes up.

Three input slider bar are present on the left to allow user to input exponential distribution lambda, the sample size of the distribution and finally the simulation times.

Three plots are on the right side that reactively plot out the mean, variance and histogram of the mean over simulation times.
